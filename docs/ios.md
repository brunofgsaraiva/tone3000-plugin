# iOS (iPad) build

Standalone-only iPad build of the plugin: the same C++ and the same React
UI, with every platform difference behind `#if JUCE_IOS`. Desktop behaviour
is unchanged. AUv3 is out of scope; iPhone is untested.

Deployment target iOS 16. Landscape only.

## Build

The UI is embedded as JUCE binary data, so it is built first.

```sh
cd ui && npm ci && npm run build && cd ..

# Simulator
cmake --preset ios-simulator
cmake --build build-ios --config Release --target TONE3000_Standalone -- -sdk iphonesimulator

# Device
cmake --preset ios-device
cmake --build build-ios-device --config Release --target TONE3000_Standalone -- \
  -sdk iphoneos -allowProvisioningUpdates
```

Build **Release** on the Simulator. A Debug iOS build points the WebView at
`http://localhost:5173/`, so it shows a dead page and logs "navigation failed".

`-DT3K_IOS_BUNDLE_ID=<id>` signs under your own identity. Changing it on a
device that already holds the app gives a fresh, empty Documents folder, so
keep it stable once models are loaded. Add
`-DCMAKE_XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_DEVELOPMENT_TEAM=<id>` if Xcode cannot pick your team.

**Reconfigure after every UI change.** `plugin/CMakeLists.txt` collects the
webview with `file(GLOB_RECURSE)`, which runs at configure time, and Vite's
asset filenames are content-hashed. Without a reconfigure the app keeps
serving the previously embedded bundle and looks like your change did nothing.
The requested asset name in the app's log tells you which bundle is running.

## Install and log

```sh
xcrun simctl install <udid> build-ios/plugin/TONE3000_artefacts/Release/Standalone/TONE3000.app
xcrun simctl launch <udid> <bundle-id>

# The app's own log: console.* from the WebView is forwarded into it, which
# is the most useful debugging channel on both Simulator and device.
tail -f "$(xcrun simctl get_app_container <udid> <bundle-id> data)/Library/TONE3000/TONE3000.log"
```

Simulator screenshots come out portrait while the app renders landscape.

## Platform notes worth knowing

- **Picker results must be read through security-scoped URLs.** A file chosen
  outside the app container is unreadable through its raw path. A test with
  the file *inside* the container passes and proves nothing.
- **The app data container's UUID rotates on every reinstall and every app
  update.** Any absolute path the plugin persisted then names a directory
  that no longer exists, and the only path it persists is a local model's
  stash URL, in the tone JSON that rides presets, the saved app state and
  undo snapshots. `resolveLocalModelFile` re-roots the stored (content-hashed)
  file name under the current stash folder; a path that still exists is used
  as-is, which is every desktop case. Presets and project state were never
  affected: they embed the model bytes.
- **Bluetooth headphones cap the whole session at 16 or 24 kHz.** The owner
  hit this on the iPad with AirPods: `prepareToPlay: sampleRate=24000` and a
  sample-rate warning in Settings with nothing saying why. JUCE opens the iOS
  session as `PlayAndRecord` with `AllowBluetoothHFP`
  (`juce_Audio_ios.cpp`, `setAudioSessionCategory`), so a headset with a
  microphone wins the route and iOS refuses the requested 48 kHz. Two answers
  ship together, both in `IosAudioRoute` (the Haptics / AudioPermissions
  shim pattern, header-only no-op off iOS):
  - `disallowBluetoothHfp()` re-sets the session category without that one
    option, keeping every other option JUCE asked for, `AllowBluetoothA2DP`
    included, so Bluetooth output-only listening still works and only the
    low-rate headset *mic* route goes away. It is not a JUCE text patch:
    JUCE sets the category when it *opens* a device and never on its own
    route-change `restart()` path, so re-applying it on every device-manager
    change is enough and the JUCE tree stays untouched. What was verified:
    the rate is right when the device is (re)opened after the option is
    gone. Whether a session already running at 24 kHz climbs back to 48 kHz
    the moment HFP is dropped, without a reopen, is not confirmed on a
    device: JUCE's `handleRouteChange` ignores `CategoryChange` and
    `RouteConfigurationChange`, so it depends on which reason iOS reports.
  - `isBluetoothRoute()` feeds `bluetoothRoute` in the settings state, and
    the UI turns that (or any session under 44.1 kHz) into one plain tip in
    Settings > System Settings, next to Sample Rate: use wired headphones,
    the iPad speaker, or a USB audio interface. The generic "runs lightest
    at 48 kHz" note is suppressed while it shows, so there is one
    explanation instead of two.
- `xcrun simctl privacy grant microphone` does not suppress the prompt;
  `AVAudioSession` still asks once.
- **`UIRequiresFullScreen` no longer opts an app out of multitasking** on
  iPadOS 26: a second app dragged from the Dock windows itself over this one
  regardless. The key is therefore not set. The app is not resized by it (the
  other app floats), so the layout is unaffected.
- The `NAM` static library must be force-loaded on iOS as well as macOS.
  `$<PLATFORM_ID:...>` reports `iOS`, not `Darwin`, when cross-compiling, so
  without both the linker strips the model-architecture registrations and
  loads fail with "No config parser registered for ...".

## Known gaps

- The UI is the desktop UI. It renders and is usable, but it is not yet
  adapted for touch: hit targets, gestures and the "On this iPad" local
  browsing section are a separate change.
- Load Folder is a multi-select on iOS: a security-scoped *directory* cannot
  be enumerated, so the picker returns files instead.
- Dragging a `.nam` from Files onto a tile is untested. The receiving code is
  the same HTML5 drop path the desktop uses, and the app does window alongside
  Files, but the drag could not be driven from the automation.
- AUv3 is not built. Only the Standalone app exists on iOS.
